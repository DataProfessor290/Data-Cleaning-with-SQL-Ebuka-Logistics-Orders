# Data-Cleaning-with-SQL-Ebuka-Logistics-Orders
This project cleans and transforms Ebuka Logisticsâ€™ customer order data using SQL. The raw CSV had duplicates, invalid dates, messy text, and nulls. I built a SQL workflow simulating ETL to standardize and prepare the dataset for analysis and reporting.
